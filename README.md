## Requirements

Develop an app where you'll have to build a custom form builder with the following details.

Show the user two options that can be added to their custom form:

Field One: A select dropdown  
Field Two: A checkbox

1. A user can add as many fields as possible from the above list
2. Each field should capture the custom label the user will be using + their input type
3. User should be able to add more options to the Select/Checkbox. By default always show one option.
4. On saving the form created, show the model with the way data is being captured by console logging it.
5. You don't have to focus on styling for the assignment and it can be bare bones. But if you have time to spend, it would be good to see it being beautiful.

Hint: For UX, you can refer to Google Forms.

## To-Do
- [ ] Add more input fields - text, date, image.  
- [ ] Replace localStorage with an actual server.  
- [ ] Add OAuth to access and fill forms.  
- [ ] Improve colours in UI.
- [ ] Make validation more customizable than just a _mandatory_ tag. Allow for regex validation as well.
